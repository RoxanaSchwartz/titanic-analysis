# Titanic Data Analysis

This project analyzes the survival rates of Titanic passengers using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Contents
- `titanic_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis and visualizations.
- `train.csv`: Input data from Kaggle.
- `titanic_output.xlsx`: Exported results with cleaned data.

## Analyses
- Survival rate by gender, class, and embarkation location.
- Age distribution of survivors vs. non-survivors.
- Fare distribution (boxplot).
- Adjustment of missing age values ​​using the median.

## Findings
- Women and first-class passengers had higher survival rates.
- More expensive tickets correlate with survival.
- Embarkation location influences survival (e.g., Cherbourg is higher).

## Tools
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Export to Excel with Openpyxl
